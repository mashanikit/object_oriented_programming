# # Create a BankAccount class
# Every bank account should have balance and interest_rate attributes
# At this point you should test out creating an instance of your class to make sure it works
# Your class should have an instance method called deposit that accepts one amount argument and adds that amount to the total balance
# Test out your method by calling it on an instance of your class
# There should be a withdraw instance method that accepts one amount argument and subtracts it from the total balance
# Don't forget to test it out!
# Finally, there should be a gain_interest instance method that increases the total balance according to the interest rate.
# Once all of that is working, don't forget to commit!
